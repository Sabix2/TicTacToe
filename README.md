# TicTacToe
I wrote a simple version of TicTacToe in python.

config.py

Window size
You can change the size of the window by giving the width a different value.
Works fine with 100 or higher.


linethickness

You can change the thickness of the lines by giving lineth1-3 different values.
lineth1 is used for the grid.
lineth2 is used for the X and O.
lineth3 is used for the line that tells if a player won.


radius

The rad variable is used for the radius of the circle and is not recommended to be changed.
The radius is calculated by taking the half of the 3rd width and subtract 10.
